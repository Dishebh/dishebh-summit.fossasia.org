Now the time has come to deploy your app so that it can be publicly available and can be used by users. you choose digital ocean to deploy your app and after struggling to install requirements, configuring your server and now your app finally deployed. Now you slept as you are tired as you worked day and night to convert your dream idea to the product. In the morning, you woke up and you see countless emails as your app hit the market and your server couldn\u2019t handle those requests so it crashed. you added more server to the fleet and sent apology mail to your existing customers, and stating that your app is back in service.</p><p style=\"\">A month later you got one email from digital ocean to pay the amount, it cost you a total of 5000$ but your app is only used by the customer in the first week and you calculated and it should cost 1500$ but the bill is 5000$. why there is a difference of 3500$ ? you now checked, and all those servers you added, cost you that much amount, they were running 24*7. Here if you used serverless than it only costs you 1500$.</p><p style=\"\">In this talk, we will see how can you use serverless to build serverless compliant apps. For the sake of example we will build serverless bots, nowadays Bot is serving to help people with their required information. You do not need an expensive internet connection to talk to the bot, but you need an expensive server to run your bot but not with the case with the serverless.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Benefits of serverless</strong>\u00a0<strong>No Administration</strong>\u00a0- We can deploy our code without provisioning anything beforehand, or manage anything afterward. There is no concept of a fleet, an instance, or even an operating system.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Scalability</strong>\u00a0- One doesn\u2019t have to care about auto-scaling, No need to show alerts or write scripts to scale up and down. With serverless, we can handle quick bursts of traffic.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Cost</strong>\u00a0- Function-as-a-service (FaaS) compute and managed services charged based on actual usage rather than pre-provisioned capacity. This means one pay the amount we use, so if we use service for 10 sec then we pay for 10 sec.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Faster Development</strong>\u00a0- Now loop between having an idea and deploying to production is shortened because no one need to manage anything after deployment, smaller teams can ship more features. It\u2019s easier than ever to make your idea live.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Easy Integration</strong>\u00a0- With Other Services Going serverless allows a seamless integration to various other cloud services from the same provider. For example, if you are using the AWS platform for chatbots, then you can use DynamoDB for the database, write programming logic as Lambda functions, and expose them through the API Gateway.</p>Session key Takeaways<p style=\"\">The main question is how to write code which is serverless compliant. This is where this session will help you. This talk will help people to move a step ahead of the traditional way of writing code as some of you had already developed chatbot, I will share how can you think (a serverless way) and write the simple chatbot in python and can take leverage of serverless to deploy and publish. I will cover:</p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Serverless Framework principals</li><li style=\"\">AWS Lambda and API Gateway</li><li style=\"\">How to write a chatbot in python and create a Lambda function</li><li style=\"\">How to troubleshoot in a serverless world</li></ul>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "<p style=\"\"><strong>Vaibhav Singh</strong>\u00a0is an undergrad final year student of BML Munjal University, Gurugram.

The F.I.R s and criminals data are registered into Blockchain application and this database is shared with the hotels and public transport systems to verify the people who check-in or travel. Now-a-days, the DNA or any sort of test reports that are to be submitted in the courts are manipulated.\u00a0 To prevent this from happening, the application allows the judge to access the medical test reports directly, eliminating the middle men which reduces the scope of manipulation to a maximum extent.\u00a0 Currently we considered six stake holders namely police, courts, C.I.D, diagnostic centers, hospitals and hotels. The application imbibes high level of security standards , hence issues related to manipulation of records can be eliminated to a maximum extent. As the details of the application are\u00a0 transparent and accessible , the public will be aware of criminal proceedings. This application is bound to instill confidence in public on the legal proceedings. Fairness in transactions is thus ensured boosting in the economy in long run.</p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "<p>Hey.!

The survey/poll in these applications can be posted by famous public figures in order to reach a wider audience. This platform offers relevant packages that can be utilized to create appropriate polling applications by the developers. The methodology provided by the platform is transparent to the public and it cannot be modified. And any modifications made to it will have an audit trail which will be visible. This platform can be utilized in number of ways. It can be used widely at the time of elections. It can also be used to gather public opinions on various government decisions.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Blockchain is well known for the four main features, namely immutability, transparency, provenance, and being the single source of truth.

Hence it is immutable. This platform provides transparency offering visibility of poll outcomes to every one. The history of the surveys/poll are available in the platform, the data can only be appended but not updated, in tandem with the provenance feature.

Whereas the customer-facing systems bring revenue into the company, the CI pipeline ensures the development teams remain productive and efficient in serving the former.\u00a0</p><p></p><p>From this talk, you can expect to pick up some tips on how to speed up your CI pipelines -\u00a0 leveraging cloud capabilities, such as horizontal scaling of its workloads to cater for more / heavier /longer builds. This leads to short feedback loops in the development cycle, and - therefore - a more efficient use of your dev team\u2019s (expensive) time.\u00a0 And for the cherry on top,\u00a0 you will probably be reducing your CI costs while doing all this!</p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "<p>N/A</p>", "photo": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3877/photo/T1pOeVM0Uj/40412163-eda8-49aa-b044-bcf2230d9741.png", "sponsorship_required": "", "id": 3877, "icon": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3877/icon/dnRTVkFHTn/4f591e20-27b6-4455-b155-3617fa447b3d.jpg", "city": "", "name": "Michal Cichra", "speaking_experience": "", "organisation": "Red Hat", "long_biography": "", "heard_from": "", "small": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3877/small/bTlLRWdSSj/dec1bf40-1a95-4b7b-af80-f00531e100d9.jpg", "thumbnail": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3877/thumbnail/eTVFc3hCNV/bdca4db5-dbe0-4cba-9ec9-d0c30cf4092f.jpg"}], "subtitle": "", "language": "", "title": "Faster, Cheaper, Leaner: Horizontally Scaling a CI Pipeline ", "track": {"color": "#a117a3", "font_color": "#ffffff", "id": 1071, "name": "Cloud, Containers, DevOps"}, "start_time": "2019-03-16T10:30:00+08:00", "level": "Intermediate", "comments": "<p>Can cover own travel / accommodation costs through employer.</p>", "slides": "", "state": "confirmed", "microlocation": {"id": 757, "name": "Lecture Theatre"}, "end_time": "2019-03-16T10:55:00+08:00", "video": "", "audio": "", "signup_url": null, "id": 4963, "long_abstract": ""}, {"session_type": {"length": "00:25", "id": 564, "name": "Talk"}, "short_abstract": "<p>Containers are everywhere, but do you know how to create the rootfilesystems that they use?\u00a0 There are simple tools available to createyour own custom Ubuntu or Debian root filesystem.\u00a0 By using these tools to build environments matching your needs, you will end up with a better understanding of how containers are built - and how to debugthem - as well as gain access to more options that can speed up your own builds and\u00a0testing.</p><p>In this presentation, I will show the debootstrap and multistrap tools and provide worked examples on how to avoid their gotchas and end up with a bootable root filesystem.</p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "<p>Hamish has always liked to bend hardware to his will, which led to a career as a Sys Admin and means that he is always trying to understand what is inside the black box.His quest to make computers do his bidding (and not theirs) has continued to drive his tinkering with software and hardware at home and at work.\u00a0 He believes in empowering others to also bend technology along with him!Hamish currently lives in Hong Kong - tiny living with his many tiny computers.</p>", "photo": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3783/photo/WVhKbkFLWH/f77c2d0b-1d76-4bdb-be67-0a4ccff52ca9.png", "sponsorship_required": "", "id": 3783, "icon": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3783/icon/RHBUc2hVdT/d38b3168-499a-4d96-b586-f7c592cdae02.jpg", "city": "", "name": "Hamish Coleman", "speaking_experience": "<p>I have presented previously at conferences such as Linux Conf AU\u00a0 as well as FOSSASIA.\u00a0 I regularly give technical talks at my local hackspace (DimSumLabs)</p><p></p>", "organisation": "Dim Sum Labs", "long_biography": "", "heard_from": "Friend", "small": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3783/small/RmRMUGdlRG/c145bbe7-cb79-4e31-b41c-1a5518312ca9.jpg", "thumbnail": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3783/thumbnail/OWMwNzVweG/e47a4971-3a82-4f0c-9f0f-f2baa549d114.jpg"}], "subtitle": "", "language": "", "title": "Creating Ubuntu and Debian container base images, the old and simple way", "track": {"color": "#a117a3", "font_color": "#ffffff", "id": 1071, "name": "Cloud, Containers, DevOps"}, "start_time": "2019-03-15T15:00:00+08:00", "level": "Intermediate", "comments": "", "slides": "", "state": "confirmed", "microlocation": {"id": 757, "name": "Lecture Theatre"}, "end_time": "2019-03-15T15:25:00+08:00", "video": "", "audio": "", "signup_url": null, "id": 5085, "long_abstract": ""}, {"session_type": {"length": "00:55", "id": 566, "name": "Panel"}, "short_abstract": "<p>AMA (Ask Me Anything) Panel Project Feedback, Bunnie, Mitch, Adnan moderated by Mario - Tell us about your project and get feedback from Open Hardware icons on your next steps.</p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "Experienced Design Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the computer hardware industry.

Networked Linux machines more and more take over tasks formerly executed by Mainframe systems. With those tasks also comes the workload which has to be managed and automated. New technologies like Business Intelligence, Data Warehousing and Big Data also require the execution of numerous programs interconnected by dependencies and synchronization needs. To manage those workloads, the use of Enterprise Job Scheduling or Workload Automation systems is self-evident in Mainframe environments for decades. In Linux environments this software class is not widely spread and automation is done using cron, built in scheduling functionality of systems like ETL tools and a bunch of scripts. This creates a numerous amount of problems regarding transparency, maintainability, stability and efficiency. One reason for this development was the lack of an Open Source Workload Automation System able to satisfy the demands. Since 2013 the schedulix Open Source Enterprise Job Scheduling System closes this gap and gives an extremely powerful and reliable tool into the hands of Linux system administrators and software developers. The other reason is the lack of knowledge on this software class and which huge benefits job scheduling systems can deliver.

Hence itself there are chances for many problems such as inconsistent data on different documents, the hoarding of documents by the evil employee and many more. This makes peoples life more harder.\u00a0 </p><p><u><b>Use-Case Scenario</b></u></p><p>This is based on a real life scenario. Consider a college student submitting a proposal for an event at the college to a professor who is the head of the club. The head verifies the request and add comments to it.

We operate at a massive scale and do a good portion of our overall GO-JEK monthly orders of a 100+ million via GO-FOOD. With 300K+ merchants, there is not only a huge variety for customers to choose from but the discovery of restaurants becomes a challenge. There was a need for improving the search experience of the user so that they can find their favorite merchants quicker, rather than to scroll through pages trying to find them. The idea of Butler was to customize the search results so as to take into account the past order history and preferred cuisines of the user. We wanted to essentially improve our Click Through Rate(percentage of merchant page visits per search sessions) and Booking Conversion Rate(percentage of search sessions that result in a booking). In this talk, we will cover the current architecture for GO-FOOD search, how we personalized the search experience through Butler and how we trained our model by collecting feedback from search results.</p><p>\n\n<b>The architecture of GO-FOOD Search</b>\n\n</p>\n<p>GO-FOOD Search architecture is a combination of Elasticsearch and Postgres. We use Elasticsearch for search and ranking of the merchants and Postgres serves as the source of truth for getting merchant details. For each search request, we first query Elasticsearch which ranks the merchants according to the search query. The search query mostly takes into account that the merchant is open and takes into account the distance from the user for the ranking. After fetching the restaurant details from Elasticsearch, we query Postgres for getting merchant details. The returned response is a combination of Elasticsearch and Postgres response.</p><p><b>Coming up with Search Personalization Architecture</b></p><p>When tasked with personalizing search results, we had to first analyze how to come up with the following: a. Fetching customer information like favorite merchants, favorite cuisine information and taking it into account for ranking merchants b. Creating a Learning To Rank model that can be used for ranking merchants</p>\n<p>a. Fetching Customer Preference Information We have an internal batch processing product named Tagstore/Tagstream which populates customer data with information about his past order history and browsing history. It also takes into account the cuisine and merchant information for which he ordered in the last 1 month and 6 months. This data is updated on a daily basis and fetching this data was just a lookup to retrieve customer information and use it to personalize the search results.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>b. Creating a learning model While analyzing our options for using a model to rank the restaurants, we found that a plugin called LearnToRank(LTR) using which we can use a learning to rank model against our searches. The initial model took into account features that capture customer-merchant browsing and ordering interactions along with the distance between the merchant and customer . A relevance by query dataset that summarizes the judgement a user made on each search listing was prepared and an LTR model that was trained using <span>Ranklib</span>.<span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Ranklib offers a suite of ML algorithms that can be used to train ranking models. The algorithm that we chose for initial experimentation was LambdaMART given that we wanted initial iterations of the model to be as interpretable as possible while using state of the art LTR models.</p>\n<p>The LambdaMART algorithm learns an ensemble of regression trees that work over each of the features given to it and maps each merchant-customer combination to one of the tree nodes along with the boost in score that should be attributed to that search listing so as to maximize a ranking quality metric. The non discounted cumulative gain(nDCG) metric computes the quality of each search result depending on the ranking positions at which the clicks and bookings occured in comparison to the best possible search ranking that could have been presented to the user.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Personalizing Search Results with Butler </b></p>\n<p>Butler is a golang app that serves as the endpoint for serving the search results from elasticsearch. With every search request, we take into account the customer id, customer location and tile that the user has selected(Example: nearby restaurants, restaurants which are open 24*7, best selling merchants etc). For personalizing the elasticsearch response, we first fetch the customer details from the tagstore that we discussed previously. After this we pass in the customer preference information as a parameter to the model in the search query. The model is used to rescore the elasticsearch documents and we get personalized response for a user\u2019s search request. When rolling out personalized search, we made sure that we roll it out only to a certain percentage of the search traffic. So we created a rollout end point for each tile, so that we can first test the personalized results for a particular tile and compare the results. Since user trends vary across different tiles, rolling it out to different tiles and measuring the non personalized vs personalized results made more sense. We also created a live dashboard that shows the booking conversion and search click conversion. Using this we were able to track how our personalized search performed against our traditional search.</p><p><b>Creating a Feedback cycle to train model from Search Results </b></p>\n<p>As part of our initial efforts, we were just tracking the SLAs, booking and search click conversions. We were not tracking the scores that LTR provides to each restaurant by considering the customer profile information. We realized that this was very vital information to train the current model. In Order to collect these metrics, we enabled LTR metric logging in the search query. After collecting the LTR metrics, we push these metrics along with the customer information to kafka.</p>\n<p>From kafka, we have cold storage pipeline setup which pushes the kafka data to GCS. The search data as well the positions at which the user clicked and made bookings from is pushed to GCS via kafka as well.

Some automation tools and services are provided by cloud\nvendors themselves. But all those services come with vendor lock: they\u2019ll only\ndeploy within their own environments.</p><p>BENEFIT OF USING TERRAFORM</p><p>Build your entire Huawei Cloud Family infrastructure with one command.\nServers, network, storage, DNS, CDNs, load balancers, and much more all have\nAPIs. Terraform is a tool to model all of these resources in a single language\nacross multiple cloud providers, then bring then up and connect them all in a\nsingle command. Terraform can then be used to model changes to your Huawei\ninfrastructure and safely effect those changes. Terraforms safety comes from\nthe ability to \"plan\" changes: Terraform shows you an execution plan\nof what it will do before it does it. You can then determine if a change is\nsafe or not and whether to apply it. Along with this safety Terraform is highly\nresistant to errors: it retries failed operations and is idempotent and can be\nrun again if an operation cannot complete the first time. In this talk we\npresent the problems faced in automating infrastructure and how Terraform is\nbeing used to solve them in production.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>USE CASES:</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Orchestrate and\nOptimize multi-cloud/tier deployments on OpenStack Clouds using Opensource\ntechnology-Terraform</p><p>Terraform is meant to help you combine all the components you\u2019ll need to\nbuild and launch your application infrastructure. It's often attractive to\nspread infrastructure across multiple clouds to increase fault-tolerance. By\nusing only a single region or cloud provider, fault tolerance is limited by the\navailability of that provider. Having a multi-cloud deployment allows for more\ngraceful recovery of the loss of a region or entire provider.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Realizing multi-cloud deployments can be very challenging as many\nexisting tools for infrastructure management are cloud-specific. Terraform is\ncloud-agnostic and allows a single configuration to be used to manage multiple\nproviders, and to even handle cross-cloud dependencies. This simplifies\nmanagement and orchestration, helping operators build large-scale multi-cloud\ninfrastructures.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You could, for instance, select a base server from Huawei Cloud, DNS\nfrom Open Telekom Cloud, and a Postgres database from Telefonica Open Cloud.\nTerraform will build a single application framework from across all these\nproviders in parallel.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>A very common pattern is the N-tier architecture. The most common 2-tier\narchitecture is a pool of web servers that use a database tier.</p><p>Terraform is an ideal tool for building and managing these infrastructures.\nEach tier can be described as a collection of resources, and the dependencies\nbetween each tier are handled automatically; Terraform will ensure the database\ntier is available before the web servers are started and that the load\nbalancers are aware of the web nodes. Each tier can then be scaled easily using\nTerraform by modifying a single count configuration value. Because the creation\nand provisioning of a resource is codified and automated, elastically scaling\nwith load becomes trivial.</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "<p>Rupal Shirpurkar is Business head at Click2Cloud Inc and\u00a0<span style=\"\">leading the entire APAC region for Business Relationship with Global Organization in China, Japan, Hongkong, USA, and Asia Pacific Region.</span>\u00a0 Rupal is Handling the Business and Engineering Operations with Huawei, OTC, Telefonica, Orange and Various Other Top Cloud providers for enabling Open source tools, SDK for Infrastructure Automation, App Containerization, and Migration.</p>", "photo": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3792/photo/M3ltb3RCVD/4c6ebfce-6747-4470-b59c-34ddc7070ae5.png", "sponsorship_required": "", "id": 3792, "icon": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3792/icon/clJBZE9YQX/ece3fbff-dcd9-4b83-bf8b-f0d5d9b280ee.jpg", "city": "Bellevue", "name": "Rupal Shirpurkar", "speaking_experience": "<p>Rupal Shirpurkar is one of the speakers in OpenInfra summit 2018 held in Beijing, China.

During the Google Summer of Code 2018, we had a number of new features and enhancements made to the SUSI server and clients. The most important part of the <a href=\"http://SUSI.AI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SUSI.AI</a> project is its skills. We aim to provide quality user experience through the skills that we have. And, to develop and improve upon the existing skills, we needed reviews and feedback from the user. Hence, a new skill rating and feedback system have been developed which allows the users to rate the skills using a five-star rating system and also provides them with a section where they can add their feedback. In case, they find any skill inappropriate, they can also report the skill. The skill rating and feedback system serve as a channel through which we get to know the needs and expectations of our users, which in turn adds to our motivation to consistently improve upon the existing skills.</p><p>Along with these new features, the clients have a new UI and the skills have been organised in a better way to provide faster access to more useful skills as per the need of the user. Also, the skills load 10x faster than they used to. A number of features, like changing the skill language, addition of more languages, etc., have been added to the web and Android/iOS clients to provide a more personalised experience to the user.</p><p>I would discuss all of the above features that I have worked on during my GSoC this year and would discuss its implementation and the technologies that have been used. I would also demonstrate how the users can help us improve the SUSI skills by providing their constructive feedback. I would also try to motivate people to contribute to our projects and help us build more robust skills that can give better responses because the intelligence of <a href=\"http://SUSI.AI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SUSI.AI</a> lies with SUSI skills.</p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "<p><span style=\"\">Arundhati Gupta is a passionate developer who works mainly in the app and web development.

Though baseline achieving i18n remains the same, it has various implementations. For example implementation of the most famous i18n framework gettext spans C/C++, Python, PHP, Java, JS, .NET and many others. Web development frameworks (like Django, Spring, Rails, Drupal, etc.) may have their own method. Some keep their language resources in PO (gettext portable object) format, others in JSON, YML, INI, RESX, PROPERTIES etc. i18n methods are being evaluated and enhanced which results in multilingual web pages getting much popularity.</p><p></p><p>Modern web applications include various frameworks mixedup, which actually takes i18n into more complex level. For example Angular UI with Django as backend code. This session shall try to demystify full-stack i18n/l10n with an example of angular-django application. Outine would be (1) introduction to gettext i18n (2) i18n/l10n steps (3) demo (4) manage translations.
